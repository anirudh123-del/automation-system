# automation-system
Creating an automated system that monitors competitors' LinkedIn activity, specifically targeting decision-makers' new connections. Based on the 'About Us' section, job description, or recent posts of these new connections, the automation should generate a hyper-personalized connection request to be sent from your LinkedIn account

1.PREREQUISITES

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

LinkedIn Developer account: Create a LinkedIn Developer account to obtain the necessary API credentials.

2.SETUP:

Clone the repository:

Obtain LinkedIn API credentials

Go to the LinkedIn Developer Portal and create a new LinkedIn application.
Note down the API Key, API Secret, User Token, and User Secret. These will be used for authentication.

4.Configure the script:

Open the Python script in a text editor.
Replace the placeholders your_api_key, your_api_secret, your_user_token, and your_user_secret in the script with the respective credentials obtained in the previous step.
Customize the search_params dictionary with the desired search parameters, such as keywords, location, and industry, to target relevant decision-makers.

5.Run the script

6.Explanation of code:

The script follows these main steps:

Import required modules and set up the LinkedIn API client:

import linkedin
from linkedin import server

# Set up API credentials
API_KEY = 'your_api_key'
API_SECRET = 'your_api_secret'
USER_TOKEN = 'your_user_token'
USER_SECRET = 'your_user_secret'

# Create a LinkedIn API client
authentication = linkedin.LinkedInDeveloperAuthentication(API_KEY, API_SECRET, USER_TOKEN, USER_SECRET, '', linkedin.PERMISSIONS.enums.values())
application = server.quick_api(authentication)
Define search parameters:


search_params = {
    'keywords': 'decision maker',
    'location': 'your_location',
    'industry': 'your_industry'
}
Customize the search_params dictionary based on your requirements. The provided example targets decision-makers with the specified keywords, location, and industry.

Search for new connections:


search_results = application.search_profile(selectors=[{'people': ['first-name', 'last-name', 'public-profile-url']}], params=search_params)
The search_profile method is used to search for profiles based on the specified selectors and parameters. In this case, it retrieves the first name, last name, and public profile URL of the search results.

Iterate over search results and retrieve profiles:

for person in search_results['people']['values']:
    profile_url = person['publicProfileUrl']
    profile = application.get_profile(member_url=profile_url)
    # Extract required information from the profile
    # ...
The script iterates over the search results, retrieves the profile URL for each person, and fetches the full profile data using the get_profile method. You can customize the information you extract from the profile based on your needs.

Generate personalized connection requests:


connection_request = f"Hi {first_name}, I came across your profile and noticed your impressive background as a {job_title}. I believe we share similar interests in {your_field}, and I'd love to connect and explore potential opportunities. Looking forward to connecting with you. Best regards, Your Name"
The script generates a personalized connection request using string formatting. Customize the message to reflect your intentions and include relevant details from the extracted profile information.

Send connection requests:


application.send_invitation(profile_url=profile_url, text=connection_request)
The script uses the send_invitation method to send the generated connection request to the specified profile URL.

Additional considerations:

The script includes a delay of 1 second after each connection request to avoid hitting rate limits imposed by the LinkedIn API. You can adjust this delay based on your specific requirements.

Make sure to handle any potential errors and exceptions that may occur during the execution of the script. Implement appropriate error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure smooth execution.

7.Usage and Customization
Customize the search_params dictionary to target specific decision-makers by modifying the search criteria such as keywords, location, and industry.

Personalize the connection request message by modifying the connection_request string. You can use string formatting to include information extracted from the profile data.

Run the script periodically to monitor competitors' LinkedIn activity and send hyper-personalized connection requests to relevant new connections.


8.Ensure compliance with LinkedIn's terms of service and API usage guidelines while using the script. LinkedIn may have specific limitations on the number of requests and the nature of automated actions.

It's recommended to test the script with a limited number of profiles initially to ensure its functionality and avoid any unexpected behavior.
